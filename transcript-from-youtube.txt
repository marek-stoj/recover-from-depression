# Keys to Unlock Depression: Why Skills Work Better Than Pills

00:03
[Applause]
00:07
thanks thanks so much
00:10
well that was a very nice introduction
00:13
thank you I want to say I'm very
00:16
grateful to Anthony for arranging this
00:20
this program this idea of his abrini
00:23
psychology to the public to me is the
00:25
most important thing that we as
00:26
psychologists can do the volume of
00:30
information is so great and the quality
00:34
of information has improved so markedly
00:36
over time that there's a lot to share
00:39
and we have a relatively short time this
00:42
evening but I hope to give you a lot of
00:44
good perspective about things that
00:46
matter the most in learning to manage
00:49
depression so let me say I will be
00:53
speaking for roughly 45 minutes or so
00:56
and then I will open it up to questions
01:00
let me start with a story and get you
01:03
thinking about this topic when I was a
01:06
young psychologist back in 1829 my first
01:14
job was working in a psychiatric
01:16
facility and I was the admissions person
01:18
it was my job to admit new patients to
01:21
the unit now this is a locked facility
01:24
people aren't getting locked up because
01:26
they're doing well they're not really
01:28
doing very well at all and so my job was
01:30
to interview them find out why they were
01:32
there what was going on in their lives
01:34
what the expectation was for their
01:37
hospitalization what medications they
01:39
were on what the treatment plan was all
01:41
those kinds of things
01:42
now I'm young I'm inexperienced and for
01:46
me to have the opportunity to interview
01:48
many hundreds of people in a relatively
01:51
short period of time turned out to be
01:54
pivotal and all the things I'm going to
01:56
talk to you about tonight I would
01:58
interview people who had been through
02:01
the worst experiences that you can
02:03
imagine people who had been raped
02:06
tortured mutilated people who had fled
02:09
their homelands literally with the
02:11
bullets with whizzing past their
02:13
had people who lost their entire family
02:16
and one fell swoop
02:17
in a plane crash or a car crash people
02:21
who had suffered the worst adversities
02:24
you can possibly imagine and when I
02:27
would interview these people it was easy
02:30
to appreciate why they were broken why
02:34
they were so despairing why they had
02:38
given up on life that was of course an
02:42
interesting lesson to say the least
02:45
the compassion the empathy was very easy
02:48
but what fascinated me clinically that
02:51
has every bit of relevance to what we're
02:54
going to talk about tonight is when I
02:56
interviewed people who had been through
02:58
these horrific experiences people who
03:01
probably should have been depressed but
03:05
they weren't and I wanted to know why
03:09
not what is it about the way that these
03:12
people are coping that somehow serves to
03:17
insulate them against depression so it
03:20
gave rise to the for research questions
03:24
that have guided my career now for more
03:26
than 40 years think about your answers
03:29
to these questions because we're going
03:31
to talk about them the first question
03:34
was are there skills that people have
03:37
that serve to insulate them very
03:41
interesting when you ask people directly
03:44
gee anybody who had been through your
03:46
circumstances would be depressed you're
03:49
not why not and people would give me
03:53
these very insightful answers like I
03:55
don't know or they would say well I
03:59
guess it's just luck of the draw or I
04:02
guess it's good genetics but they
04:05
couldn't really give me any insight into
04:08
that they're just living it they're just
04:10
being who they are doing what they're
04:12
doing so as a young researcher
04:14
interviewing people and asking a million
04:17
questions slight exaggeration and you
04:20
find out that they like murder mysteries
04:23
and they like taking walks in the park
04:24
and they like playing with their kids
04:26
grandkids and they like ice cream and
04:29
they like all kinds of things and there
04:31
I am trying to figure out so what is it
04:34
well we've answered that question now
04:37
it's the ice cream if only it were that
04:42
simple so starting to identify what
04:46
patterns are present in the way this
04:48
person thinks about things in the way
04:50
they define problems in the way that
04:53
they define their relationships what are
04:55
they doing in there and what emerged
04:58
from that with great clarity were
05:01
certain patterns of self-organization
05:04
keep that phrase in mind patterns of
05:07
self-organization so then the question
05:11
became okay if I think I have a handle
05:13
on what's going on with these folks what
05:16
we can learn from them it leads to the
05:19
second question can we say that these
05:22
skills that these people have are in
05:25
fact learn about are they teachable
05:28
isn't this what the purpose of therapy
05:31
is is to help people acquire these
05:33
skills that are not intuitive for them
05:36
that are intuitive for these other
05:39
people then the third question became
05:42
the salient research question can we
05:45
prove scientifically empirically that
05:48
when people are taught these particular
05:51
skills that it makes a difference that
05:53
it reduces their level of depression
05:55
reduces the frequency of depression
05:57
reduces their vulnerability to relapses
06:01
reduces the impact on the people around
06:04
them this is one of the things about
06:07
depression it doesn't just affect the
06:09
individual sufferer one of my recent
06:12
books is called depression is contagious
06:14
and not in a viral sense not in a
06:18
bacterial sense but in a social sense
06:20
what is it about depression that is so
06:23
easily transmitted to kids of depressed
06:27
parents if you're the child of a
06:29
depressed parent your likelihood of
06:32
suffering depression is three to six
06:35
times greater than if you are the child
06:37
of a non depressed
06:39
just having a depressed parent is a
06:41
massive risk factor not a small one
06:45
a big one so can we prove that by people
06:49
acquiring and developing the skills that
06:51
it really makes a difference and then
06:53
the fourth question has to do with
06:56
prevention now bear in mind I'm asking
06:59
these questions more than 40 years ago
07:01
when we didn't have good antidepressant
07:04
medications we had medications that
07:06
weren't particularly effective and
07:08
people didn't want to take them they had
07:10
annoying little side-effects like death
07:13
and so all in the span of 40 years all
07:19
of those things have changed we have
07:21
better medications we have far better
07:23
psycho therapies a far better insight
07:25
into what depression is who's vulnerable
07:28
and under what conditions but the idea
07:31
at that time of even thinking about
07:33
depression in terms of prevention was
07:37
sheer fantasy we didn't have good
07:39
treatment much less good opportunities
07:41
for prevention so I will summarize my
07:44
response to all four of these questions
07:47
yes yes yes and yes what we have learned
07:52
is that there are certain
07:53
vulnerabilities risk factors a risk
07:57
factor is anything that increases the
08:00
likelihood of somebody suffering a
08:02
particular disease or condition and at
08:05
the time that I started studying
08:06
depression we knew of exactly two risk
08:08
factors gender and family history we now
08:13
know that there are scores of risk
08:16
factors factors that increase
08:18
vulnerability to depression and I'm
08:21
going to talk about some of the key ones
08:22
this evening now part of what came out
08:27
of that initial study was the
08:30
recognition that it's not just what
08:32
happens to you you know for the people
08:35
who say well the reason I'm depressed is
08:37
because here's what happened to me when
08:38
I was a kid or the reason that I'm
08:41
depressed is because I lost my job or
08:43
the reason I'm depressed is because this
08:45
person broke up with me that's only
08:48
partially true at best
08:51
it's far less about what actually
08:54
happens to you and it's far more about
08:57
how you interpret how you give the
09:00
significance to what kind of meaning you
09:04
attach to the events in your life and
09:06
part of what we've learned is that
09:09
there's a phenomenon called
09:11
attributional style a pattern of how
09:14
people reflexively unconsciously
09:18
interpret the significance of events and
09:21
this is something that is imperative to
09:24
appreciate for all of us because this is
09:27
where some of the strongest risk factors
09:30
reside as I'll get into in just a little
09:33
while but let's backtrack to the most
09:36
basic of questions if we ask the
09:39
question what is depression
09:41
well depression is technically
09:45
considered a mood disorder but it's far
09:47
more than that depressions tentacles
09:51
reach into every part of a person's life
09:55
it affects not just your mood it affects
09:58
your physiology your physical health and
10:02
how depression serves as a risk factor
10:05
for many different conditions most
10:08
notably cardiovascular disease in fact
10:11
there are cardiologists around the world
10:13
who are recommending screening for
10:15
depression as the first screen for
10:17
cardiovascular disease but others as
10:20
well and it reaches into your ability to
10:24
think and make decisions and it's one of
10:27
the things I'm going to talk about a
10:28
little bit later is the quality of
10:30
people's decisions and how their way of
10:32
making decisions actually
10:34
unintentionally reinforces depression it
10:38
affects job performance and your ability
10:40
to function in the work that you do it
10:42
affects concentration
10:44
how many work-related accidents that
10:47
damage people and damaged people's lives
10:49
are caused by inattention caused by
10:52
depression it affects relationships it's
10:56
hard to be around people who are
10:58
depressed it ends up damaging
11:01
relationships and of course all that
11:03
leads to is more
11:04
isolation and more depression so I can
11:07
go on and on about all the different
11:09
tentacles of depression but you should
11:11
get the idea that this isn't just a bad
11:14
mood there are a lot of things that are
11:16
very persistent very enduring about the
11:19
patterns that give rise to depression in
11:22
the first place that effect a quality of
11:24
life over the span of a lifetime so then
11:27
if we come to the question what causes
11:29
depression is depression caused by now
11:33
look at this list if you were to
11:37
research every one of these factors you
11:41
would find that there is abundant
11:43
evidence for all of them and more and if
11:48
you look at this list you'll notice that
11:49
some of these factors are biological
11:52
factors some of these factors are
11:55
psychological factors some of these
11:58
factors are social factors and the more
12:02
that we have learned about depression
12:05
the more that we learn how important the
12:08
social side of the equation really is
12:11
that so many of the risk factors for
12:14
depression when I talk about depressed
12:16
parenting and why kids of depressed
12:19
parents are it's so much higher risk it
12:21
isn't through genetics it's through
12:24
modelling as a parent you can't teach
12:28
kids what you don't know and so it
12:31
becomes an interesting field of research
12:34
what is the relationship between family
12:37
structure family coping styles family
12:40
atmosphere and depression and leave it
12:43
in general for the moment there are some
12:45
very significant factors that operate in
12:47
that arena it's why I wrote the book
12:50
depression is contagious because these
12:53
factors now are being recognized across
12:56
a variety of fields
12:57
so to summarize that point how important
13:01
it is to appreciate and have a
13:03
multi-dimensional viewpoint yes biology
13:07
matters but surprisingly not as much as
13:11
you would think
13:12
that when we look at what's termed
13:15
genetic variance
13:16
how much do genes play a role in
13:19
depression is there a depression gene no
13:23
are there genes that make people
13:26
vulnerable to depression definitely and
13:30
so if we look at biochemistry yes it's a
13:34
factor if we look at disease processes
13:38
there are many diseases where depression
13:40
is a predictable consequence if we look
13:43
at drugs there are many drugs that have
13:47
depression as a predictable side effect
13:50
biology matters but when we look at
13:53
genetic variance that figures between
13:55
point three and point four there
13:58
represents a mild moderate at best
14:01
genetic influence so when we look at the
14:04
site power the psychological factors
14:07
individual history individual
14:09
problem-solving styles individual coping
14:12
styles these are the kinds of things
14:14
that are in the domain of individual
14:18
psychology another one that I mentioned
14:20
just a moment ago attributional style
14:22
the person's habitual or reflexive way
14:26
of attaching meaning to life events and
14:29
that the social side of the equation as
14:33
we've learned from studies of
14:34
depressions prevalence a field called
14:38
epidemiology this has been particularly
14:41
revealing I don't know if you saw the
14:43
the big announcement last year from the
14:46
World Health Organization well in 2004
14:51
the World Health Organization which
14:53
monitors health issues of all types
14:56
around the world including depression
14:58
but other things as well cancer aids MS
15:02
you name it in 2004 the World Health
15:05
Organization declared depression the
15:08
number four cause of human suffering and
15:11
disability behind cancer heart disease
15:16
and traffic accidents they predicted in
15:19
2004 that by the year 2020 depression
15:24
would rise to be
15:25
number two in fact depression reached
15:29
number two in late 2013 last year just
15:34
around this time depression was declared
15:37
the number one cause of human suffering
15:40
and disability and the numbers are
15:43
increasing there is no demographic group
15:46
where the numbers are going down in
15:49
every demographic group the numbers are
15:51
going up when we look at the
15:54
epidemiology it's the 25 to 44 year-olds
15:58
who represent the largest group of
16:00
depression sufferers but the
16:03
fastest-growing group is their children
16:06
and this is one of the things that I am
16:10
deeply concerned about now when you see
16:12
a 14 year old or a 15 year old who's
16:15
already suffering depression shows the
16:17
signs has the symptoms as dealing with
16:19
it that's a basis for concern what's an
16:23
even stronger basis for concern is what
16:25
happens ten years from now when this
16:27
depressed adolescent becomes a parent we
16:32
now have three generation studies that
16:35
show remarkably clearly that from one
16:38
generation to the next
16:40
depression increases in prevalence
16:42
depression increases in severity I'm
16:46
worried
16:46
especially about the youngest among us
16:49
who are at a very elevated risk right
16:53
now for all kinds of reasons one of the
16:56
points about the social side of
16:58
depression why is depression increasing
17:01
so dramatically think about your
17:04
response to that well the societal
17:07
structure has changed radically over
17:10
time and when we look at things like the
17:14
influence of Technology that smartphone
17:18
that you're carrying around represents
17:21
one of the strongest risk factors there
17:23
is for young people today who are no
17:27
other way to describe it
17:29
addicted to the technology survey after
17:32
survey showing that if you ask somebody
17:34
to stop checking their phone for two
17:37
hour
17:37
they react really badly it's so
17:41
engrained into their quality of life and
17:44
as a general principle the more time you
17:47
spend in front of a screen whether it's
17:49
a small one whether it's a big one the
17:51
more likely you are to suffer depression
17:53
you've been hearing about the what
17:56
people are calling the epidemic of
17:58
loneliness paradoxically in this
18:02
terribly overcrowded world people are
18:05
dying of loneliness and the fact that
18:09
people are as disconnected as they are
18:12
plays a significant role so when I talk
18:15
about what causes depression the best
18:18
answer I can give you is many many
18:21
things and that's precisely why each
18:24
person's pathway into depression is
18:27
different it's why whatever pathway this
18:30
person is gonna find out of depression
18:32
is going to have to be unique to them is
18:35
there a best treatment for depression
18:37
absolutely not
18:39
is there a best approach absolutely not
18:42
the best approach is the one that works
18:44
for you and that's an important thing
18:47
because as a consumer that as you
18:50
approach the decision to seek help to
18:54
take advantage of the fact that there
18:56
are experts who have been studying these
18:58
things for a very long time and have
19:01
learned a lot and know how to do
19:02
treatment quite well that your path is
19:07
going to be different and unique
19:09
there is no standardized treatment
19:11
there's no standardized way of doing
19:12
this and so this is an important point
19:16
I'm talking now about your risk factors
19:20
yours you as an individual they're not
19:23
the same as others when I say each
19:25
person has their own pathway in and it's
19:28
going to have to develop their own
19:29
pathway out your task is learning what
19:33
your vulnerabilities are learning what
19:36
your risk factors are what is very
19:38
troublesome for one person isn't the
19:40
least bit troublesome for someone else
19:42
what one person avoids with every ounce
19:45
of energy they have somebody else walks
19:47
into openly and happily
19:49
everybody's different and so when we
19:52
look at that point which is really
19:54
nothing to sneeze at we we really have
19:57
to appreciate that it's that level of
20:00
individual attention learning about
20:03
yourself that becomes one of the most
20:04
important things that you can do so when
20:07
we look at the fact that currently the
20:11
most common form of treatment the most
20:13
popular form of treatment so had the
20:15
antidepressant medication now
20:18
antidepressant medications really came
20:21
became popular in the late 1980s with
20:24
the first release of Prozac the first of
20:27
the newer generation antidepressants I'm
20:31
not gonna say a lot about
20:32
antidepressants right now you know just
20:34
a couple of general comments what I will
20:37
say definitively is medications are too
20:42
heavily relied upon medications are
20:45
viewed as somehow going to be the answer
20:48
and I can tell you the more that we
20:51
understand the social aspect of
20:53
depression the more confidently I can
20:56
say to you there will never be a drug
20:59
that cures depression any more than
21:01
there will be a drug that cures racism
21:03
or poverty looking at it through the
21:06
lens of biology is an exceptionally
21:08
limited perspective why I made a point
21:11
of showing you the slide that shows you
21:13
the biological factors psychological
21:15
factors social factors now it's not that
21:19
I am against antidepressants you know
21:22
part of writing for encyclopedia
21:24
Britannica's I can't just say it because
21:26
it's my opinion where's the evidence for
21:28
it antidepressants can do two things
21:31
reasonably well they can help you manage
21:34
the vegetative symptoms things like
21:36
sleep disturbance appetite disturbance
21:39
and they can raise the floor on
21:42
depression now that will be true for
21:45
roughly half the people who take
21:48
medications if you take medication alone
21:51
it's something to reconsider medications
21:55
have the highest rate of relapse of any
21:58
form of tree
21:59
so even if you happen to be a fan of
22:02
medication and believe me there are
22:04
people who say to me all the time that
22:07
medication saved my life I believe them
22:10
there's no reason to disbelieve them but
22:13
the larger point I'm making is it's not
22:16
enough it's not enough and here's why
22:20
it's not enough no amount of medication
22:23
is going to help you develop skills and
22:26
managing stress none no amount of
22:30
Education is going to help you develop a
22:32
better attributional or explanatory
22:34
style or help you build and maintain
22:37
positive relationships with other people
22:40
or it's helped you develop the kinds of
22:42
cognitive skills that help you think
22:44
critically about experience instead of
22:47
just getting sucked in by your feelings
22:49
it's not going to help you develop
22:51
problem-solving skills it's not going to
22:54
help you develop better decision-making
22:56
strategies it's not going to teach you
22:58
how to build a support and network with
23:00
people it's not going to help you come
23:02
to terms with whatever crummy things
23:05
have happened in your life and it's
23:07
certainly not going to help you build
23:08
one of the most important things one of
23:12
the most important things in getting
23:14
treatment is how to build a compelling
23:17
future you know the past whatever
23:22
de-stresses whatever traumas whatever
23:24
situations you Fath you've faced I get
23:29
that I listen to those experiences all
23:32
the time and they're tragic but if we
23:35
ask the question who overcomes
23:38
depression and who doesn't the people
23:41
who find themselves facing forward who
23:44
start thinking in terms of how do I want
23:47
my life to be do better than the people
23:51
who keep focusing on the past the
23:53
unchangeable past and that's really the
23:57
key and this drugs aren't going to help
24:00
you do that so if we look at what these
24:03
risk factors are that I'm talking about
24:06
when I said there are scores of risk
24:09
factors
24:09
literally dozens and dozens of risk
24:12
factors things that singly and in
24:14
combination can give rise to depression
24:17
very easily I want to highlight for you
24:21
some of the key ones some of the risk
24:23
factors that have a greater impact than
24:26
do others and I'm gonna describe these
24:28
for you and give you an idea of what
24:30
they look like sound like and what you
24:32
can actually do about them how we doing
24:34
okay so the first one let me name them
24:39
first the internal orientation stress
24:41
generation rumination global thinking
24:45
and finally unrealistic expectations
24:48
let's look at each risk factor
24:51
individually and how it influences your
24:53
overall quality of experience the first
24:57
one the internal orientation what I'm
25:01
talking about the internal orientation
25:03
very simply I mean what people do is
25:06
they use themselves as the reference
25:09
point they use their feelings to make
25:14
decisions they use their feelings to
25:17
interpret the things that they're
25:19
interpreting events that happen in their
25:22
life the internal orientation drives you
25:27
in wordly there are actually some
25:30
depression writers who have framed
25:32
depression as being the most
25:33
narcissistic of all states now that's
25:37
clearly an exaggeration but it does
25:41
speak to the quality of self-absorption
25:43
what I mean by the internal orientation
25:46
and when you use your feelings as the
25:49
indicator of what to do you're going to
25:52
make mistakes now I know that there are
25:55
people running around loose in the world
25:57
who will say to you trust your feelings
25:59
listen to your feelings listen to what
26:02
your heart tells you I can tell you as a
26:05
psychologist and depression expert that
26:08
is really bad advice really bad advice
26:13
because your feelings can too easily
26:16
deceive you people can so easily think
26:20
things are worse than they really are
26:23
people can think things are better than
26:26
they really are to be able to have the
26:29
ability to go outside yourself and learn
26:32
something about what's actually going on
26:34
out there well when I say internal
26:40
orientation
26:42
it's the subjectivity here's what I
26:45
believe here's how I feel this is the
26:49
way it is and when people make bad
26:52
decisions that unintentionally make
26:55
their life worse that really speaks to
26:58
what I'm going to talk about next with
27:00
stress generation but the point I'm
27:02
making now about what does this mean in
27:05
terms of what to actually do I put here
27:09
the goal is to learn to reality test one
27:12
of the most important skills you can
27:14
develop in life is reality testing how
27:18
do I go outside myself in order to know
27:23
whether this is really what's happening
27:25
and if you look at the times that people
27:27
get in the most trouble it's when they
27:29
get wrapped up inside and whatever they
27:31
happen to believe that may have next to
27:33
nothing to do with what's actually going
27:36
on out there
27:37
clinicians call this cognitive rigidity
27:40
in plain language what it means is the
27:45
key problem with depressed people is
27:49
that they think things and then make the
27:53
mistake of actually believing themselves
27:57
thinking is dangerous potentially and
28:03
without the ability to learn how to go
28:06
outside yourself in reality test all you
28:09
can do is be a prisoner of your own
28:11
thoughts and if your own thoughts are
28:13
depressing you're in trouble and it's
28:17
why especially here in Australia where
28:20
CBT is one of the most commonly applied
28:22
approaches and appropriately so helping
28:25
people learn the cognitive skills of how
28:28
to gather information and how to use it
28:30
instead of just jumping to unfounded
28:34
conclusions and believing the things
28:36
that
28:36
go on and of course this also relates to
28:39
the social isolation one of the values
28:42
of relationships is when you have people
28:44
close enough to you that you can say to
28:46
them here's what's going on here's what
28:49
I think about it and hopefully they care
28:51
about you enough and they're close
28:53
enough with you to be able to say to you
28:55
I don't think you're right about that
28:58
it's why the most important skill to
29:01
counter cognitive rigidity is cognitive
29:04
flexibility how can you train yourself
29:06
to generate multiple explanations for
29:10
things that happen simple example I call
29:14
you up you're not home I leave a message
29:17
hi it's Michael
29:19
it's 10:00 a.m. call me back it's now 10
29:23
p.m. at night and you haven't called me
29:25
back if I am a depressed person what is
29:29
my predictable attribution or
29:32
explanation for why you didn't call me
29:33
back you don't care about me anymore
29:38
that'll cheer me up but it doesn't stop
29:43
there
29:44
then it goes to the next level of how
29:46
come people don't care about me why
29:48
aren't people ever responsive to me why
29:51
aren't people ever staying my friends
29:53
and the next thing you know this
29:55
person's built this up and built this up
29:57
until it's literally a suicidal crisis
30:00
because you didn't call them back
30:02
that's how it works that's the internal
30:06
orientation training people to generate
30:09
multiple explanations why did this
30:12
person call back could be this could be
30:14
this could be this could be this could
30:16
be this which one is it I don't know to
30:21
master the art of recognizing what you
30:24
don't know instead of making stuff up
30:28
and then actually believing yourself the
30:31
second risk factor is called stress
30:33
generation this is actually one of the
30:36
most recently developed models of
30:38
depression and it has attained already a
30:41
significant level of empirical support
30:44
what stress generation speaks to is
30:48
how people make decisions that
30:51
complicate their depression exacerbate
30:53
their depression they don't do it
30:55
intentionally but it speaks to the
30:58
quality of their decision-making
30:59
strategies and when people don't have
31:03
good decision-making strategies when
31:05
they just follow their heart just follow
31:07
their feelings they're going to make
31:10
mistakes so for example I can say to my
31:14
depressed client I can see from all the
31:19
cobwebs all over you that you really
31:21
don't move much
31:22
and knowing that exercise has a
31:26
treatment success rate that matches the
31:29
antidepressants with a much much lower
31:31
relapse rate it really would be a good
31:34
idea for you to exercise and invariably
31:37
my client says I know but I don't feel
31:41
like it bad decision your friends say to
31:47
you wow you are really bummed out you
31:49
are depressed you need help go to the
31:52
doctor and you say no bad decision you
31:58
go to the doctor the doctor says here's
32:01
the name of three therapists pick one
32:03
you need help you take the names
32:08
promptly crumple them up throw them away
32:11
bad decision that's what I mean by
32:15
stress generation how many decisions do
32:17
you make in the span of a day and this
32:21
is what we find this comes out of the
32:23
field of affective neuroscience which is
32:27
just a fancy title for how do moods
32:29
influence decision-making processes it's
32:33
a fascinating field and it speaks to the
32:36
fact that these aren't just cognitive
32:38
processes that happen mood influences
32:41
them your mood influences what you
32:44
remember your mood influences how you
32:47
remember your mood influences the
32:50
quality of choices that you make obvious
32:53
examples if you're angry are you going
32:57
to be more or less willing to take risks
33:01
more if you're afraid are you more or
33:07
less likely to take risks less your mood
33:11
state influences your perceptions your
33:14
mood state influences the quality of
33:17
decisions and helping people make better
33:20
decisions filtering the mood out of the
33:22
process is one of the most important
33:24
things that we do clinically in the
33:27
therapeutic work that we do so you look
33:31
at these things
33:31
don't isolate socialize I don't feel
33:35
like it stop drinking I don't feel like
33:40
it why do I say stop drinking if you are
33:44
depressed if you are vulnerable to
33:47
depression your alcohol intake should be
33:50
zero alcohol is a bad drug for people
33:56
who are depressed or prone to depression
33:58
it has been shown to aggravate the same
34:01
neural pathways as depression if you are
34:04
a depressed person your alcohol
34:06
consumption should be zero and when you
34:10
say that to somebody particularly if
34:13
their Australian they say I don't think
34:16
so I'm not going to do that
34:19
bad decision so that's part of the task
34:25
is learning how to take actions that are
34:29
consistent with the goals more so than
34:33
taking actions consistent with the
34:35
feelings the feelings come and go the
34:37
consequences last and to start to think
34:41
in those terms becomes a very different
34:43
paradigm for people who are used to
34:46
following their feelings so closely the
34:48
internal orientation I was talking about
34:50
that is not one of the seven Habits of
34:54
Highly Effective People
34:56
when I say alcohol is a bad drug I am
34:59
understating it when we look at the next
35:02
risk factor rumination rumination means
35:06
spinning around the same thoughts over
35:09
and over and over again and analyzing
35:11
and analyzing an animal
35:13
at the expense of taking action
35:17
rumination drives the symptoms of
35:20
anxiety rumination drives the symptoms
35:24
of depression for the people who are
35:27
ruminate errs they have much more
35:28
difficulty with even the most basic
35:30
things like sleeping because their brain
35:33
doesn't stop they're always thinking
35:35
about their problems always thinking
35:37
about the issues trying to figure out
35:39
what to do next
35:40
and the idea of course is thinking about
35:43
problems is generally useful depending
35:46
how you think about them if you keep
35:49
analyzing but never take action you're
35:52
gonna feel worse if there is a cure for
35:55
rumination its action but it has to be
35:59
timely action it has to be effective
36:01
action it's not just action for the sake
36:04
of action that doesn't count as action
36:09
so the ability to be able to convert
36:12
rumination to action and when we look at
36:16
the things that people ruminate about
36:18
it's almost invariably about
36:21
relationships and probably number two is
36:24
school and work-related issues but
36:27
relationships are the most prominent and
36:29
many of the relationships of course are
36:31
relationships from the past this is one
36:34
of the factors of depression every
36:37
problem has a structure every problem
36:41
every diagnostic label has components
36:44
one of the components of depression is
36:47
what's called a past orientation people
36:51
come in and they say my past controls me
36:57
it's because of these traumas in my past
36:59
it's because of these things my parents
37:01
did it's because of these things that
37:03
happened to me when I was a kid and they
37:06
don't just ruminate about the past
37:08
although they do that but when I say
37:10
they're also using the past as a
37:12
reference point I'm saying they use the
37:14
past to predict the future so they say
37:18
things like I'll never be happy
37:21
prediction for the future why not
37:23
because I never have been
37:26
I'll never get a good job why not
37:28
because I've never had one I'll never
37:30
have a good relationship
37:32
why not because I've never had one and
37:34
of course the most popular one of all I
37:36
won't be happy until my parents treat me
37:39
better when I was a kid and for as long
37:44
as somebody gets caught up in that loop
37:47
they're not going anywhere
37:49
why it becomes so incredibly important
37:52
to convert to action and I'm constantly
37:56
having to remind people whatever your
37:59
history is you're more than your history
38:04
you're more than your history you're
38:07
more than any one characteristic you're
38:09
more than your job you're more than your
38:11
title you're more than your income
38:13
you're more than your body size you're
38:16
more than how many likes you get on
38:18
Facebook or Instagram or any of these
38:20
other social media things all of that
38:23
stuff doesn't ultimately matter and
38:27
can't be the basis for defining self and
38:31
when people define themselves the thing
38:34
that's troublesome about having to tell
38:36
people you're more than your history is
38:38
that when people learn a therapist says
38:42
who them you are a trauma survivor you
38:45
are an abuse survivor on one level that
38:49
sounds very empowering on another level
38:53
you're literally adopting the label that
38:57
says that you can globally define
39:00
yourself by your unchangeable history
39:04
the last thing you want to do is define
39:07
yourself by your unchangeable history
39:10
why that orientation of the future what
39:14
the possibilities are if I could get
39:16
every person to absorb that simple
39:20
phrase create possibilities there aren't
39:25
any guarantees in life but we can take
39:29
actions that create possibilities for
39:32
the future there is a danger with
39:37
rumination
39:38
of thinking too much the unexamined life
39:42
isn't worth living said Socrates there
39:52
is a danger in thinking too much and
39:55
there's a specific discrimination that
39:58
has to be made when is it useful
40:01
analysis and when is it useless
40:05
rumination and I'll answer the question
40:08
for you if it doesn't lead to timely and
40:12
effective action
40:13
it's useless rumination the next risk
40:18
factor one of the strongest ones is
40:21
what's called a global cognitive style
40:24
if there is such a thing as a typical
40:26
depressed person which obviously there
40:29
isn't but if there was such a thing one
40:32
of the core features is global cognition
40:35
global cognitive style means the person
40:39
engages in over general thinking her
40:43
boyfriend breaks up with her she says
40:45
men his girlfriend breaks up with her
40:49
women
40:51
that's over general thinking as if
40:54
they're all the same somebody has a bad
40:57
day and they don't say I had a bad day
40:59
they say why is life so unfair now we
41:04
just went from a bad day to life could
41:07
we make it any bigger than that but what
41:09
it translates into is when people walk
41:12
and sit down and they say to me well all
41:15
I want is to be happy is that too much
41:18
to ask all I want is a good relationship
41:22
is that too much to ask and then I'll
41:25
ask the specifics so what do you think
41:27
it takes to build a good relationship
41:29
and the person comes back with an
41:31
equally global response when they say
41:34
chemistry
41:38
if you think in those global terms
41:43
metaphorically you see the forest but
41:45
you don't see the trees then you can't
41:48
be an effective problem solver you can't
41:52
solve problems specifically by taking a
41:54
global approach to it
41:56
now this isn't global about everything
41:59
of course somebody can be very specific
42:01
about the way they manage their bank
42:03
account and very global in the way that
42:05
they approach relationships and it's the
42:08
things that you don't know about that
42:10
you are inevitably global for a general
42:14
understanding but you can't learn skills
42:18
that way if I want to teach you to drive
42:21
a car I can't say to you become one with
42:26
the auto you're gonna do a lot better if
42:30
I say see this this is a steering wheel
42:32
see that that's a brake pedal to get the
42:36
specifics and learn to think in specific
42:39
terms is a real challenge when your
42:42
cognitive style is a global one why it's
42:46
so important to have goals but goals
42:49
have to be defined a goal without steps
42:54
is merely a wish what that translates
42:59
into one of the most important exercises
43:02
is called a flow of steps this is how we
43:06
train people to go from global to linear
43:09
in their thinking I will give you the
43:11
homework assignment as your therapist of
43:14
picking something that you know how to
43:16
do something simple you know how to
43:19
dress yourself you know how to go
43:21
grocery shopping you know how to take a
43:23
shower well you don't just take a shower
43:28
that's a global phrase taking a shower
43:33
is a global phrase that represents how
43:35
many steps involved so I will give the
43:39
client the task of I want you to
43:43
delineate every step involved in taking
43:46
a shower I want you to pretend that
43:48
somebody who's never done it before
43:51
is gonna follow your sequence and your
43:53
job is to guarantee that they succeed at
43:56
it bring it back to me next time they
43:59
come back the next time they have three
44:01
steps get wet lather up rinse off now if
44:07
that's what you think goes into taking a
44:10
shower what does that say about your
44:13
ability to be specific and problem-solve
44:16
I'm the one who then has to say excuse
44:19
me but how do you find where a shower is
44:22
and when you find where a shower is how
44:25
do you open the door and how do you walk
44:27
through the door and how do you turn on
44:28
a light switch and how do you close the
44:30
door and do remember to take your
44:31
clothes off and what about opening the
44:33
shower door moving the shower curtain
44:36
and reaching inside and turning on the
44:37
hot and turning on the cold and then
44:39
testing it out and then flicking the
44:41
switch from tub to shower and by the
44:43
time you sequence it out depending on
44:47
your amount of detail there's gonna be
44:49
at least fifty steps involved in taking
44:50
a shower and what if you miss one of
44:54
them you didn't know you had to flick
44:56
the switch from tub to shower so there
44:59
you are standing there naked watching
45:01
water running down the drain I'm such a
45:04
loser yeah everybody else can take a
45:08
shower and I can't what's wrong with me
45:11
and that's the point
45:13
once I have exhausted there's taking a
45:16
shower flow of steps then I give them
45:19
the next one now that you've done the
45:21
flowchart for how to take a shower now I
45:23
want you to do the flowchart for how to
45:25
be happy and that's the first time the
45:29
person realizes they have not a clue and
45:32
then they discover instantly why it
45:36
isn't happening
45:38
if you can't sequence what you're trying
45:42
to do it isn't going to happen
45:44
this requires a very specific quality of
45:49
thinking that global thinkers have a
45:51
hard time doing it's a training process
45:54
training your brain to think in more
45:58
linear terms in the specific areas where
46:00
you need help otherwise all you can do
46:04
is go glow
46:05
men women and mists how to distinguish
46:11
who the good ones are from who the not
46:13
so good ones are do a flowchart for that
46:17
okay then the last one I'm going to
46:20
speak to quickly
46:21
the unrealistic expectations our
46:26
expectations are the filter for how we
46:29
judge everything if I'm doing what you
46:33
think I should do as a speaker talking
46:35
about depression tonight then you're
46:37
very happy with me if I'm not doing what
46:40
you think I should do then you're not
46:41
happy with me our expectations are the
46:45
filters for how we make judgments about
46:47
anything whether it's a movie that we
46:50
see whether it's a restaurant that we go
46:52
to whether it's a party that we go to
46:54
and it begs the question how do you know
47:00
whether your expectations are realistic
47:03
what happens so commonly as a pathway
47:06
into depression for so many is that they
47:08
have unrealistic expectations they don't
47:11
know they have unrealistic expectations
47:13
so they're always walking around hurt
47:15
and disappointed I swear to God every
47:20
morning I want to call the White House
47:23
and say let me talk to Milania and get
47:27
her on the phone and say Milania I
47:30
understand why you value fidelity I
47:33
understand why faithfulness in the
47:36
relationship matters to you but look at
47:39
who you're married to the closest this
47:43
guy's gonna come to say no to someone is
47:45
when he says not how we're landing what
47:50
she wants
47:52
makes sense but not from him if you
47:59
really loved me you'd win the lottery
48:03
she doesn't look so happy and what I'm
48:07
really curious about is his response to
48:10
it I'd love to hear what he says next
48:13
does he say to her your expectations are
48:16
a little off since on
48:18
the one in control of the lottery or is
48:20
he gonna say I wonder if that's true
48:22
maybe I don't love you enough maybe I
48:24
don't know how to love maybe I'm
48:26
defective emotionally maybe I don't go
48:28
off into a whole thing about his ability
48:32
to love so when we look at how important
48:37
expectations are it's a really good idea
48:41
before you walk into your professor's
48:44
office before you ask for a friend for a
48:47
favor before you ask your boss for a
48:49
special consideration before you ask
48:52
your husband or wife or boyfriend or
48:54
girlfriend or partner for whatever it is
48:56
you want it would first be really nice
48:59
to know can this person do this is this
49:03
a part of this person's makeup is it
49:05
realistic to expect that this person can
49:08
do honesty or that they can do integrity
49:10
or that they can do patience or anything
49:14
else that you would want from this
49:15
person how often people get into
49:18
relationships with other people and
49:20
they're forever pulling on them you know
49:22
I want affection you never give me
49:25
affection well you know the fact that
49:27
you're dating mr. Spock poses a problem
49:30
you've got to know who you're dealing
49:33
with and what that whether the
49:34
expectations are realistic before you
49:37
walk into a situation that's charged
49:39
before you walk into a job interview
49:42
before anything lay it out what are your
49:46
expectations how do you know whether
49:48
this is realistic or not if you get good
49:51
at doing that you will save yourself a
49:54
lot of disappointment well I mentioned
49:58
just in passing the thing that impresses
50:00
me the most about all the things I'm
50:02
talking about to you is that when we
50:05
have integrated these things into
50:07
prevention programs the very skills that
50:10
I'm talking to you about now when we
50:13
have run prevention programs with
50:15
high-risk populations and been able to
50:18
demonstrate very scientifically that
50:21
when people learn these skills their
50:24
vulnerability to depression drops
50:26
dramatically so for example we did a
50:29
program that lasted six
50:31
months with elementary school kids who
50:34
were at high risk high risk because they
50:36
came from very unstable family
50:38
environments divorce violence abuse all
50:40
kinds of things that were really bad in
50:44
these kids lives and for two hours
50:48
every other week for six months total of
50:50
24 hours these kids were trained in
50:52
problem-solving social skills and then
50:56
we followed these kids for almost ten
50:58
years they had less than half the rate
51:01
of depression less than half the rate of
51:03
teenage pregnancy less than half the
51:05
rate of drug abuse as the kids who did
51:08
not go through the program that's
51:10
impressive and that's 24 hours worth of
51:13
basic teaching of skills these skills
51:16
that I'm talking to you about tonight
51:18
not only have treatment value they have
51:21
prevention value well let me highlight
51:24
for you then some very direct advice to
51:28
bring let this lecture to a close
51:31
getting professional help is an
51:34
important thing to do you don't know
51:37
your own blind spots you're blind to
51:41
your own blind spots the stuff that you
51:43
struggle with and struggle with and
51:45
struggle with you go see somebody who
51:47
knows what they're talking about and
51:48
they can say in five minutes here's what
51:50
you're missing here's what we can do
51:51
about it problem solved it's not always
51:54
that easy by any stretch of the
51:56
imagination
51:56
but the point being there's a good value
51:59
and having trained eyes and ears on what
52:02
you're dealing with
52:03
so how do you know when you need
52:05
professional help first and foremost
52:07
suicidal thoughts
52:09
somebody's even remotely contemplating
52:12
that that is the first cue you need help
52:16
now before you do something impulsive
52:19
secondly when you're feeling stuck and
52:21
hopeless when you don't have the support
52:24
or people around you that you can
52:27
reality test with before it reaches a
52:30
crisis point how often people wait until
52:33
everything's in flames and then they go
52:36
get help
52:36
well you don't have to wait until it's
52:39
in flames how about you take care of it
52:41
before things get worse
52:43
that requires foresight the ability to
52:48
make good decisions I have emphasized
52:51
when you have to make big decisions am I
52:54
going to go to this school or that
52:55
school am I gonna live here live there
52:57
am I gonna marry this person am I going
52:59
to move in with this person shall we put
53:01
have mom live with us or not live with
53:03
us should I take this job in another
53:05
city what should I do you have big
53:08
decisions to make you really don't want
53:10
to make them through the filter of
53:11
depression I spoke about how depression
53:13
affects the quality of decision-making
53:16
good idea to have somebody else to
53:19
reality test with when you know that
53:22
you're affecting other people the only
53:26
responsible thing to do is to get help
53:28
so you are not contaminating them every
53:32
depressed person on average affects at
53:35
least three other people negatively and
53:38
if you know that that depression makes
53:41
you irritable and angry and over
53:44
reactive and critical and harsh and all
53:47
the nasty things that come out of people
53:49
when they're not feeling good you owe it
53:52
to the people that are in your sphere of
53:54
influence to make sure you get the help
53:56
that you need it's important to shop for
54:01
a therapist like any field would matter
54:04
if we're talking about plumbers or
54:06
electricians in any field there are
54:08
people who are more well trained people
54:10
who are better skilled people who have
54:13
more experience and it means that your
54:16
job is going to be to shop and to have
54:19
the kinds of questions handy that you
54:23
need to have answered is this person
54:26
experienced with depression what is
54:28
their general approach to it what's
54:29
their style how active are they in the
54:32
treatment process will they assign
54:34
homework to you will they involve other
54:37
people couples work family work other
54:40
people who are involved in this problem
54:42
for you are they available for
54:45
appointments how do what do they charge
54:47
how long are their sessions that's what
54:49
I mean by shopping to have plenty of
54:52
questions ready for as you interview
54:54
different therapists for who you click
54:57
with
54:57
who you discover just by talking with
55:00
them you can tell that there's some some
55:03
juice there that that you want to be
55:05
with this person so I gave you all these
55:09
things about choosing a therapist let me
55:11
just give you the last couple of slides
55:13
of very specific bullet point pieces of
55:16
advice if you're dealing with depression
55:20
first get a thorough physical exam when
55:25
I say that biology matters this is the
55:28
starting place to make sure that there
55:30
isn't anything going on medically that
55:32
would give rise to depression as a
55:34
consequence avoid alcohol completely yes
55:39
you strive to learn about your
55:42
vulnerabilities and develop ways to
55:44
manage them what are your specific risk
55:47
factors what are the things that you're
55:49
reactive to that other people are not
55:51
particularly reactive to learn to
55:54
distinguish facts from feelings beliefs
55:58
from facts sleep is such a critically
56:02
important issue it's the number one
56:05
complaint of people who suffer
56:06
depression how it affects their quality
56:09
of sleep creates insomnia no surprise
56:13
then that fatigue is the second most
56:15
common complaint a very important thing
56:18
to be able to take sleep seriously
56:20
sleeping with your smartphone not a good
56:23
idea having your computer on not a good
56:26
idea having roommates that are blasting
56:29
Jimmy Hendrix at 3:00 in the morning not
56:31
a good idea being very very careful
56:33
about the environment you create
56:36
challenge yourself 50 times a day here's
56:40
what I think how do I know reality
56:43
testing such a critically important
56:45
skill exercise easy available it works
56:50
and part of the reason it works is not
56:52
just because of the neurochemical that
56:54
hypothesis is a reasonable one but the
56:57
other thing about exercise is the gains
56:59
are to be made very quickly you start
57:01
exercising today you can barely walk
57:03
half a block and you stay with it in two
57:06
weeks from now you're walking a mile
57:09
games happen very quickly and for people
57:11
who typically have low frustration
57:13
tolerance this is a good way to get
57:16
ahead relatively quickly do fun things
57:19
and do them often one of the first
57:22
things to go when somebody's depressed
57:24
is their sense of humor there's nothing
57:26
worse than when you crack a joke to
57:28
somebody in their response to it is and
57:33
it ends there to do fun things to follow
57:38
the motto that at least some of the time
57:41
dare to be superficial get and stay
57:48
connected to other people learn to relax
57:52
relaxation processes meditation
57:54
visualization guided imagery hypnosis
57:57
any kind of relaxation process is going
58:00
to be beneficial being goal-oriented in
58:05
the important areas of your life but
58:07
again they have to be realistic goals if
58:10
you can't do the flow of steps if you
58:12
don't know what the steps are
58:14
then you're caught up in that you wish
58:17
but you don't really have a plan
58:20
prioritize and problem-solve get support
58:23
get help don't wait if I'm going to talk
58:26
about the things to do I might as well
58:29
talk about the things not to do don't
58:33
dwell on the past it's gone but tomorrow
58:37
hasn't happened yet really focus on what
58:41
can I do that'll be different in the
58:43
future that'll change how I feel about
58:45
the past don't compare yourself to
58:48
others this is one of the worst things
58:50
about social media if you watch social
58:53
media if you participate in social media
58:55
how easy it is to conclude everyone else
58:58
is having fun everyone else is lovable
59:01
everyone else is popular everyone else
59:04
is going places that are cool everyone
59:06
else is and I'm not guaranteed pathway
59:10
into feeling lousy comparing yourself to
59:12
other people particularly when you don't
59:15
have any information you know you can't
59:18
look at a picture and say that that's
59:19
this person's life that's global
59:22
thinking
59:23
don't catastrophize it helps to
59:26
understand the probabilities don't leave
59:31
important things unsaid or unresolved
59:34
closure counts for a lot
59:37
don't analyze too deeply move on don't
59:42
ignore reality get the facts don't
59:47
ignore your own needs self-care is not
59:50
the same as being selfish you're the
59:53
only one who can manage yourself and
59:55
here's a key point no mood expert that I
60:01
know of would ever talk about curing
60:03
depression keep this point from this
60:07
lecture the goal is not to cure
60:10
depression the goal is to learn how to
60:13
manage your moods death phrase manage
60:18
your moods you don't exercise once and
60:22
now you're done with the exercise thing
60:23
you don't discipline your kid once and
60:26
now you're done with the parenting thing
60:27
you don't make a bank deposit once and
60:30
now you're done with the banking thing
60:32
these are things you have to manage
60:34
every day of your life and managing your
60:38
mood requires the skills psychologists
60:42
call it self-regulation but the simple
60:45
phrase managing your mood counts it's
60:49
what I'm really speaking about it helps
60:52
to have a realistic expectation who gets
60:55
depressed everybody everybody's
60:59
vulnerable if you are capable of moods
61:01
you're capable of mood disorders
61:06
learning how to manage that aspect of
61:09
yourself is so critically important
61:12
don't give up or be passive try again
61:16
but do something different don't isolate
61:19
find good people to be with and don't
61:22
leave time unstructured there is so so
61:26
much more I could say I feel like I have
61:30
hit many of the key things to get across
61:33
to you
61:34
I hope you feel the same way well
61:38
Michael it's difficult to believe that
61:40
our time has already come to an end it's
61:43
really been an experience of time
61:46
distortion in this room it's been a
61:48
fascinating overview of depression join
61:51
